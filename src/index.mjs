  'polygon',
  // The <polyline> SVG element is an SVG basic shape that creates straight lines connecting several points. Typically a polyline is used to create open shapes as the last point doesn't have to be connected to the first point. For closed shapes see the <polygon> element.
  'polyline',
  // The <radialGradient> SVG element lets authors define radial gradients to fill or stroke graphical elements.
  'radialGradient',
  // The <rect> element is a basic SVG shape that creates rectangles, defined by their corner's position, their width, and their height. The rectangles may have their corners rounded.
  'rect',
  // A SVG script element is equivalent to the script element in HTML and thus is the place for scripts (e.g., ECMAScript).
  'script',
  // The <set> element provides a simple means of just setting the value of an attribute for a specified duration. It supports all attribute types, including those that cannot reasonably be interpolated, such as string and boolean values. The <set> element is non-additive. The additive and accumulate attributes are not allowed, and will be ignored if specified.
  'set',
  // The <solidcolor> SVG element lets authors define a single color for use in multiple places in an SVG document. It is also useful as away of animating a palette colors.
  'solidcolor',
  // The <stop> SVG element defines the ramp of colors to use on a gradient, which is a child element to either the <linearGradient> or the <radialGradient> element.

  'style',
  // The svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of any SVG document but it can also be used to embed a SVG fragment inside any SVG or HTML document.
  'svg',
  // The <switch> SVG element evaluates the requiredFeatures, requiredExtensions and systemLanguage attributes on its direct child elements in order, and then processes and renders the first child for which these attributes evaluate to true. All others will be bypassed and therefore not rendered. If the child element is a container element such as a <g>, then the entire subtree is either processed/rendered or bypassed/not rendered.

  // Each container element or graphics element in an SVG drawing can supply a <title> element containing a description string where the description is text-only. When the current SVG document fragment is rendered as SVG on visual media, <title> element is not rendered as part of the graphics. However, some user agents may, for example, display the <title> element as a tooltip. Alternate presentations are possible, both visual and aural, which display the <title> element but do not display path elements or other graphics elements. The <title> element generally improves accessibility of SVG documents.
  'title',
  // Within a <text> element, text and font properties and the current text position can be adjusted with absolute or relative coordinate values by including a <tspan> element.
